# Azure Network Security Groups (NSG)

- You can filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network with a Network Security Group.
- A Network Security Group (NSG) contains a list of Access Control List (ACL) rules that allow or deny network traffic to subnets, NICs, or both.
- NSGs contain two sets of rules: inbound and outbound. The priority for a rule must be unique within each set.
