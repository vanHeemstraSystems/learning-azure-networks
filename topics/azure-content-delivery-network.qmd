# Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers developers a global solution for rapidly delivering high-bandwidth content to users by caching their content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world.

When to leverage a CDN:

- You want point-of-presence locations that are close to large clusters of users.
- You want to reduce latency - both the transmission delay and the number of router hops.
- You want custom domains, file compression, caching, and geo-filtering.
