# Azure Bastion
The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service, which provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to your virtual machine directly in the Azure portal over TLS.

Recommended Azure Bastion when you need to:

- Secure remote connections from the Azure portal to Azure VMs.
- Eliminate exposing RDP and SSH public IP addresses of your Azure VMs.
- Access VMs across multiple, peered networks.
