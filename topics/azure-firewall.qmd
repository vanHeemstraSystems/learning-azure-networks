# Azure Firewall
Azure Firewall is a cloud-native network security service offering high-availability and scalability. Azure Firewall provides inbound protection for non-HTTP/S protocols 9for example, RDP, SSH, FTP), outbound network-level protection for all ports and protocols, and application-level protection for outbound HTTP/S.

- Configure spoke-to-spoke connectivity.
- Monitor incoming and outgoing traffic.
- If you require multiple firewalls.
