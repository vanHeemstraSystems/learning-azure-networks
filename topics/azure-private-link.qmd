# Azure Private Link
Azure Private link enables you to access Azure PaaS Services (for example, Azure Storage and SQL Database) and Azure hosted customer-owned/pertnet services over a private endpoint in your virtual network. Private Link is used to access PaaS services such as Azure Storage, Azure SQL, App Services and more as illustrated below.

Recommend private link or private endpoints when:

- You need private connectivity to services on Azure.
- You need integration with on-premises and peered networks.
- You need traffic to remain on Microsoft network, with no public Internet access.
