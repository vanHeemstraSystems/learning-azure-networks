A VPN Gateway is a type of Virtul Network Gateway that sends encrypted traffic between an Azure Virtual Network and an On-Premises location.

Benefits:

- Simple to configure.
- Up to 10 Gbps depending on the VPN Gateway SKU.

Challenges:

- Requires an On-Premises VPN device.
- The SLA only covers the VPN Gateway, and not your network connection to the Gateway or throughput.
