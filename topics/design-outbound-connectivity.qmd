# Design Outbound Connectivity
Virtual Network NAT (Network Address Translation) simplifies outbound-only Internet connectivity for virtual networks. When configured on a subnet, all outbound connectivity uses your specified static public IP addresses. NAT is fully managed and highly resilient.

Options include:

- Azure Firewall.
- Load Balancer.
- Virtual Network NAT Gateway.

Choose Virtual Network NAT Gateway when:

- You need on-demand outbound to Internet connectivity without pre-allocation.
- You need one or more static public IP addresses for scale.
- You need configurable idle timeout.
- You need TCP reset for unrecognized connections.
