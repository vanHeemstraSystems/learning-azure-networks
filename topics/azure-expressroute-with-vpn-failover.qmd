# Azure ExpressRoute with VPN Failover
This option combines the previous two, using Azure ExpressRoute in normal condition, but failing over to a VPN connection if there is a loss of connectivity in the ExpressRoute circuit.

Benefits:

- High availability if the ExpressRoute circuit fails, although the fallback connection is on a lower bandwidth network.

Challenges:

- Complex to configure. You need to set up both a VPN connection and an ExpressRoute circuit.
- Requires redundant hardware (VPN appliances), and a redundant Azure VPN Gateway connection for which you pay charges.
